INTERVIEW 1
Question: Do you think wearing an electronic monitoring tag affected your mentality towards committing crime?

Answer: No, I think it did not. It was just a matter of time before it became a problem. I don't think I would have done it if it wasn't for the fact that I didn't know what to do with my life. The only thing I did know was that it was time to get out of the house and go to the police station. That was the only way I knew how to deal with the situation. If I had known what was going to happen to me, then I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to go out and commit a crime. However, if I hadn't known that there would be consequences for my actions, it would've been very difficult for me to make the decision to commit the crime I was in the first place. So I decided to take it upon myself to find a way to
Question: Do you think wearing an electronic monitoring tag would work for all offenders?

Answer: No, it would not. It would only be useful for those who have been convicted of a serious crime, such as drug trafficking, or who are in the process of committing a violent crime. However, if you do not want to wear a tag, you should not wear it at all. If you are a person who has been arrested for a crime and you have not been charged with any other offense, then you will not be able to use the electronic tag. You will be required to pay a fine of up to $1,000 for each violation of the law. In addition to paying the fine, the person will also have the right to appeal the decision to the Superior Court of New Jersey. The court will then decide whether or not to issue an injunction against the use of electronic tags, and if so, how long it will take
Question: What other methods apart from electronic monitoring tags would be useful to reduce reoffending?

Answer: Electronic monitoring is the most effective way to prevent re-offenders from committing crimes. It is also one of the safest and most cost-effective ways to deter crime. Electronic surveillance tags can be used to identify individuals who are at risk of committing a crime, such as drug dealers, gang members, and other criminals. The use of electronic surveillance can also reduce the likelihood that a person will commit another crime by reducing the chance that they will be arrested and charged with a criminal offense. In addition, it can help reduce recidivism rates, which are higher for people who have been convicted of a violent crime than for those who did not commit the crime in the first place. This is especially true for young people, who tend to be more likely than older people to commit violent crimes, especially if they are under the age of 25

Question: Do you think wearing an electronic monitoring tag affects the mentality of offenders towards committing crime?

Answer: No, it does not. In fact, there is no such thing as a "smart tag." It is simply a tag that is attached to a person's cell phone, which is used to track their movements. The tag can be placed anywhere on the body of the offender, and it can also be used by the police to identify the person who is committing the crime. If the tag is placed on someone else's body, then it is not a smart tag, but rather a surveillance tag. This means that if someone is arrested for a crime, they will not be able to see the tags on their cell phones, because they are not being tracked. However, if an offender is convicted of an offense, he or she will have to pay a fine of up to $1,000 to the Department of Corrections
Question: Do you think wearing an electronic monitoring tag would work for all offenders?

Answer: No, it would not. It would only be useful for those who have been convicted of a crime and who are in the process of re-offending. The electronic tagging would be used to identify offenders who may have committed other crimes, such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and to prevent them from returning to the community. In addition, the tags would allow the police to keep track of who has been arrested, who is in custody, where they are being held, how long they've been in jail, whether they have a criminal record or not, what they're doing with their time in prison, etc., and so on. If you have any questions or concerns about the use of these tags, please contact the Department of Public Safety at (202) 522-4200.

Question: What other methods apart from electronic monitoring tags would be useful to reduce reoffending?

Answer: The use of electronic tagging would reduce the number of people who are arrested and charged with a crime. It would also decrease the amount of time they spend in jail. The more time spent in prison, the more likely they are to commit crimes, and the longer they have to serve their time. In addition, it would make it easier for law enforcement to identify offenders who have already been convicted of a felony, such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drug paraphernalia, or who may have a history of mental illness or substance abuse problems. This would help reduce recidivism rates, which have been declining in recent years.
